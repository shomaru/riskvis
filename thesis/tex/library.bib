One of the key elements that characterizes modern social network analysis is the use of visualizations of complex networks. Compared to staring at edge lists or network matrices (see Section 3.2.4), looking at a network graph can provide an overview of the structure of the net- work, calling out cliques, clusters, communities, and key participants. It could be said that a graph is worth a thousand ties. Not only can network visualizations inspire understanding and insights, they can also be appealing and even beautiful. They can serve as persuasive tools that demonstrate important points about networks. The ability to map attribute data and network metric scores to visual properties of the vertices and edges (see Chapters 4 and 5) makes them particularly powerful. However, network visualizations are often as frustrating as they are appealing. Network graphs can rapidly get too dense and large to make out any meaningful patterns as illustrated in Figure 3.5. Many obstacles like vertex occlusions and edge crossings make creating well-organized and readable network graphs challenging. There is an upper limit on the numbers of vertices and edges that can be displayed in a bounded set of pixels; typically only a few hundred or thousand vertices can be meaningfully and distinctly represented on average- sized computer screens. In his appeal for better-quality network visualization, Shneiderman [40] has suggested that we aspire to reach the worthy but not always attain- able goal of “netviz nirvana” in which the following goals are proposed:
-Every vertex is visible.
-Every vertex’s degree is countable (i.e., the number of connections that start or end at that vertex).
-Every edge can be followed from source to destination.
-Clusters and outliers are identifiable.
        
To approach netviz nirvana, careful preparation, layout, and filtering techniques must be used. In practice, network visualizations often fall far from the mark. However, the graphs shown throughout this book illustrate the value of carefully crafting network graphs. We hope they will inspire network analysts to take the care needed to create substantive, understandable, and aesthetically pleasing graphs.},

Four alternative logics of attachment - accumulative advantage, homophily, follow-the-trend, and multiconnectivity - are tested to explain the structure and dynamics of interorganizational collaboration in biotechnology. Using multiple novel methods, the authors demonstrate how different rules for affiliation shape network evolution. Commercialization strategies pursued by early corporate entrants are supplanted by universities, research institutes, venture capital, and small firms. As organizations increase their collaborative activities and diversify their ties to others, cohesive subnetworks form, characterized by multiple, independent pathways. These structural components, in turn, condition the choices and opportunities available to members of a field, thereby reinforcing an attachment logic based on differential connections to diverse partners.},

Therefore, different approaches have been proposed for managing networks patterns and structures according to the visualization purposes. This paper presents a method of social networks visualization devoted not only to analyse individual and group social networking but also aimed to stimulate the second-one. This method provides (using a hybrid visualization approach) both an egocentric as well as a global point of view. Indeed, it is devoted to explore the social network structure, to analyse social aggregations and/or individuals and their evolution. Moreover, it considers and integrates features such as real-time social network elements locations in local areas. Multidimensionality consists of social phenomena, their evolution during the time, their individual characterization, the elements social position, and their spatial location. The proposed method was evaluated using the Social Interaction Map (SIM) software module in the scenario of planning and managing a scientific seminars cycle. This method enables the analysis of the topics evolution and the participants' scientific interests changes using a temporal layers sequence for topics. This knowledge provides information for planning next conference and events, to extend and modify main topics and to analyse research interests trends.

Based upon a review of existing frameworks and our own experiences building visualization software, we present a series of design patterns for the domain of information visualization. We discuss the structure, context of use, and interrelations of patterns spanning data representation, graphics, and interaction. By representing design knowledge in a reusable form, these patterns can be used to facilitate software design, implementation, and evaluation, and improve developer education and communication.},

Previous studies have shown that human perceptions of network features can be affected by the layout of a sociogram McGrath et al. 1996, 1997. An empirical user study has been conducted to investigate effectiveness of five different network visualization conventions and impact of edge crossings on sociogram perceptions, using both quantitative performance and preference measures and qualitative questionnaire study. This paper reports results and findings of the questionnaire study. We relate qualitative questionnaire results with quantitative findings and discuss their implications for sociogram design. We found that subjects had a strong preference of placing nodes on the top or in the center to highlight importance, and clustering nodes in the same group and separating groups to highlight groups. They had tendency to believe that nodes in the center or on the top are more important, and nodes in close proximity belong to the same group. Some preliminary recommendations for sociogram design and hypotheses about human reading behaviors are proposed.},

@article{VanWijk2006,
abstract = {The field of visualization is maturing. Many problems have been solved and new directions are sought. In order to make good choices, an understanding of the purpose and meaning of visualization is needed. In this paper, visualization is considered from multiple points of view. First, a technological viewpoint is adopted, where the value of visualization is measured based on effectiveness and efficiency. An economic model of visualization is presented and benefits and costs are established. Next, consequences and limitations of visualization are discussed (including the use of alternative methods, high initial costs, subjectiveness, and the role of interaction). Example uses of the model for the judgment of existing classes of methods are given to understand why they are or are not used in practice. However, such an economic view is too restrictive. Alternative views on visualization are presented and discussed: visualization as an art, visualization as design and, finally, visualization as a scientific discipline.},

To address these issues, we have created prefuse, a software framework for creating dynamic visualizations of both structured and unstructured data. prefuse provides theoretically-motivated abstractions for the design of a wide range of visualization applications, enabling programmers to string together desired components quickly to create and customize working visualizations. To evaluate prefuse we have built both existing and novel visualizations testing the toolkit's flexibility and performance, and have run usability studies and usage surveys finding that programmers find the toolkit usable and effective.},

Algo- rithms are categorized based on the assumptions they make about the data being visualized; we call this set of assumptions the design model. Because our taxonomy is based on design models, it is more flexible than existing taxonomies and considers the users conceptual model, emphasizing the human aspect of visualization. Design models are classified according to whether they are dis- crete or continuous and by how much the algorithm designer chooses display attributes such as spatialization, timing, colour, and transparency. This novel approach provides an alternative view of the visualization field that helps explain how traditional divisions (e.g., information and scientific visualization) relate and overlap, and that may inspire research ideas in hybrid visualization areas.},

MatrixExplorer provides several novel features to support the exploration of social networks with a matrix-based representation, in addition to the standard interactive filtering and clustering functions. It provides tools to reorder (layout) matrices, to annotate and compare findings across different layouts and find consensus among several clusterings. MatrixExplorer also supports Node-link diagram views which are familiar to most users and remain a convenient way to publish or communicate exploration results. Matrix and node-link representations are kept synchronized at all stages of the exploration process.},

abstract = {Social roles in online discussion forums can be described by patterned characteristics of communication between network members which we conceive of as structural signatures.' This paper uses visualization methods to reveal these structural signatures and regression analysis to confirm the relationship between these signatures and their associated roles in Usenet newsgroups. Our analysis focuses on distinguishing the signatures of one role from others, the role of answer people." Answer people are individuals whose dominant behavior is to respond to questions posed by other users. We found that answer people predominantly contribute one or a few messages to discussions initiated by others, are disproportionately tied to relative isolates, have few intense ties and have few triangles in their local networks. OLS regression shows that these signatures are strongly correlated with role behavior and, in combination, provide a strongly predictive model for identifying role behavior (R =.72). To conclude, we consider strategies for further improving the identification of role behavior in online discussion settings and consider how the development of a taxonomy of author types could be extended to a taxonomy of newsgroups in particular and discussion systems in general.},

@article{Olmeda-Gomez2009,
abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to visualize the inter-university and international collaboration networks generated by Spanish universities based on the co-authorship of scientific articles. Design/methodology/approach - The approach takes the form of formulation based on a bibliometric analysis of Spanish university production from 2000 to 2004 as contained in Web of Science databases, applying social network visualization techniques. The co-authorship data used were extracted with the total counting method from a database containing 100,710 papers. Findings - Spanish inter-university collaboration patterns appear to be influenced by both geographic proximity, and administrative and political affiliation. Inter-regional co-authorship encompasses regional sub-networks whose spatial scope conforms rather closely with Spanish geopolitical divisions. Papers involving international collaboration are written primarily with European Union and North and Latin American researchers. Greater visibility is attained with international co-authorship than with any other type of collaboration studied. Research limitations/implications - Impact was measured in terms of journals rather than each individual paper. The co-authorship data were taken from the Web of Knowledge and were not compared with data from other databases. Practical implications - The data obtained in the paper may provide guidance for public policy makers seeking to enhance and intensify the internationalization of scientific production in Spanish universities. Originality/value - The Spanish university system is in the midst of profound structural change. This is the first paper to describe Spanish university collaboration networks using social network visualization techniques, covering an area not previously addressed.},

Afterwards, the models were assembled in a single virtual scene that reproduces the Forum as it would actually appear to a tourist. The scene can be visualized by means of stereoscopic devices to increase the feeling of immersion. During the data conversion process we had to face three main kind of problems: the database optimization, the correction of digital objects position into the scene and the realism of the displayed model.

Using 2 practices as illustrations, we describe how SNA can be used to characterize and compare communication patterns in primary care practices. METHODS: Based on data from ethnographic field notes, we constructed matrices identifying how practice members interact when practice-level decisions are made. SNA software (UCINet and KrackPlot) calculates quantitative measures of network structure including density, centralization, hierarchy and clustering coefficient. The software also generates a visual representation of networks through network diagrams. RESULTS: The 2 examples show clear distinctions between practices for all the SNA measures. Potential uses of these measures for analysis of primary care practices are described. CONCLUSIONS: SNA can be useful for quantitative analysis of interaction patterns that can distinguish differences among primary care practices.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the sensitivity of centrality metrics as a key metric of social networks to support visual reasoning. As centrality represents the prestige or importance of a node in a network, its sensitivity represents the importance of the relationship between this and all other nodes in the network. We have derived an analytical solution that extracts the sensitivity as the derivative of centrality with respect to degree for two centrality metrics based on feedback and random walks. We show that these sensitivities are good indicators of the distribution of centrality in the network, and how changes are expected to be propagated if we introduce changes to the network. These metrics also help us simplify a complex network in a way that retains the main structural properties and that results in trustworthy, readable diagrams. Sensitivity is also a key concept for uncertainty analysis of social networks, and we show how our approach may help analysts gain insight on the robustness of key network metrics. Through a number of examples, we illustrate the need for measuring sensitivity, and the impact it has on the visualization of and interaction with social and other scale-free networks.},

abstract = {Internet Relay Chat is a system that allows groups of people to collaborate and chat from anywhere in the world. Clearly defined by several RFC documents, it is arguably the most standard real-time chat system currently in use. This paper describes a method of inferring the social network of a group of IRC users in a channel. An IRC bot is used to monitor a channel and perform a heuristic analysis of events to create a mathematical approximation of the social network. From this, the bot can produce a visualization of the inferred social network on demand. These visualizations reveal the structure of the social network, highlighting connectivity, clustering and strengths of relationships between users. Animated output allows viewers to see the evolution of the social network over time. Some novel ideas for future work are discussed, showing other useful applications of this system.},

In such cases a large portion of edges can be shown to be less important and removed while preserving component connectedness and other features (e.g. cliques) to more clearly reveal the network's underlying connection pathways. This simplification approach deterministically filters (instead of clustering) the graph to retain important node and edge semantics, and works both automatically and interactively. The improved graph filtering and layout is combined with a novel computer graphics anisotropic shading of the dense crisscrossing array of edges to yield a full social network and scale-free graph visualization system. Both quantitative analysis and visual results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.},

abstract = {Purpose: The leaving expert (LX) is often regarded only as an issue for the retention of his or her knowledge for the business or organization. The purpose of this paper is to show that a more comprehensive knowledge perspective reveals various issues and leads to different knowledge management (KM) remedies. paper approaches the topic from an instruments or process aspect as well as from a case study view. One of the remedies is described in depth based on considerable application experience: the Leaving Expert Debriefing, a planning and knowledge transfer process. The general approach of prophylaxis and/or bridge over by excellent KM is also taken into consideration with an overview on useful KM detail processes or instruments. Findings: The Leaving Expert Debriefing process based on a comprehensive perspective of knowledge has proven to be a useful planning and knowledge transfer instrument, especially when applied early enough. On the other hand, continuously furthered good KM solutions and processes considerably reduce risks in LX issues. Practical implications: The paper offers many details, for the most part based on practical experience on how to successfully apply the Leaving Expert Debriefing process and what else KM can also contribute. Originality/value: The Leaving Expert Debriefing process is described in detail showing that various knowledge transfer and development actions for the different forms of knowledge have to be defined and focused on strategically business-critical knowledge areas. It is positioned as one of many KM remedies for the LX issue. Two quite different real-life LX cases and KM applications for them are described: the LX as a knowledge vault versus a node in a knowledge network.

abstract = {It is common to think of statistical graphics and data visualization as relatively modern developments in statistics. In fact, the graphic representation of quantitative information has deep roots. These roots reach into the histories of the earliest map-making and visual depiction, and later into thematic cartography, statistics and statistical graphics, medicine, and other fields. Along the way, developments in technologies (printing, reproduction) mathematical theory and practice, and empirical observation and recording, enabled the wider use of graphics and new advances in form and content. This chapter provides an overview of the intellectual history of data visualization from medieval to modern times, describing and illustrating some significant advances along the way. It is based on a project, called theMilestones Project, to collect, catalog and document in one place the important developments in a wide range of areas and fields that led tomod- ern data visualization. This effort has suggested some questions of the use of present-day methods to analyze and understand this history, that I discuss under the rubric of statistical historiography.},

A visual representation of the networks helps users to gain insights about the useful information mined from the networks. Many existing visualizers represent social networks as graphs. While the graphs depict pairwise connections between two social entities, they may not show the connection strength or the multi-entity relationship (e.g., coauthorship and collaboration frequency). In this paper, we propose a visualizer called SocialViz for providing users with frequency information on social relationship among multiple entities in the networks.

In traditional graph drawing the goal is to produce the best layout of given graph. SNA (Social Network Analysis) is a part of data analysis. Its goal is to get insight into the structure and characteristics of given network. There is no single answer usually we are trying to find interesting facts about the network and present them to the users.

abstract = {Exploratory visualization enables the user to test scenarios and investigate possibilities. Through an exploration the user may change various parameter values of a visualization system that in turn alters the appearance of the visual result. For example, the changes made may update what information is being displayed, the quantity or resolution of the information, the type of the display (say) from scatter plot to line-graph. Furthermore, the user may generate additional windows that contain the visual result of the new parameters so they can compare different ideas side-by-side (these multiple views may persist such that the user can compare previous incarnations). Commonly these windows are linked together to allow further investigation and discovery, such as selecting by brushing or combined navigation. There are many challenges, such as linking multiple views with different data, initializing the different views, indicating to the user how the different views are linked. This chapter provides a review of current Multiple Linked-View tools, methodologies and models, discusses related challenges and ideas, and provides some rudiments for coordination within a geovisualization context. The types and uses of coordination for exploratory visualization are varied and diverse, these ideas are underused in geovisualization and exploratory visualization in general. Thus, further research needs to occur to develop specific geovisualization reference models and extensible systems that incorporate the rich variety of possible coordination exploration ideas.},

abstract = {The need to visualize large social networks is growing as hardware capabilities make analyzing large networks feasible and many new data sets become available. Unfortunately, the visualizations in existing systems do not satisfactorily resolve the basic dilemma of being readable both for the global structure of the network and also for detailed analysis of local communities. To address this problem, we present NodeTrix, a hybrid representation for networks that combines the advantages of two traditional representations: node-link diagrams are used to show the global structure of a network, while arbitrary portions of the network can be shown as adjacency matrices to better support the analysis of communities. A key contribution is a set of interaction techniques. These allow analysts to create a NodeTrix visualization by dragging selections to and from node-link and matrix forms, and to flexibly manipulate the NodeTrix representation to explore the dataset and create meaningful summary visualizations of their findings. Finally, we present a case study applying NodeTrix to the analysis of the InfoVis 2004 coauthorship dataset to illustrate the capabilities of NodeTrix as both an exploration tool and an effective means of communicating results.},

Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known-a collaboration network and a food web-and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

This connectedness is found in many incarnations: in the rapid growth of the Internet, in the ease with which global communication takes place, and in the ability of news and information as well as epidemics and financial crises to spread with surprising speed and intensity. These are phenomena that involve networks, incentives, and the aggregate behavior of groups of people; they are based on the links that connect us and the ways in which our decisions can have subtle consequences for others. This introductory undergraduate textbook takes an interdisciplinary look at economics, sociology, computing and information science, and applied mathematics to understand networks and behavior. It describes the emerging field of study that is growing at the interface of these areas, addressing fundamental questions about how the social, economic, and technological worlds are connected.},

Various social relationships are thus created, connected, and migrated from our real lives to the Internet environment from different social groups. Many social communities and relationships are also quickly constructed and connected via instant personal messengers, blogs, Twitter, Facebook, and a great variety of online social services. Since social network visualizations can structure the complex relationships between different groups of individuals or organizations, they are helpful to analyze the social activities and relationships of actors, particularly over a large number of nodes. Therefore, many studies and visualization tools have been investigated to present social networks with graph representations. In this chapter, we will first review the background of social network analysis and visualization methods, and then introduce various novel visualization applications for social networks. Finally, the challenges and the future development of visualizing online social networks are discussed.},

abstract = {Social network analysis (SNA) has emerged as a powerful method for understanding the importance of relationships in networks. However, interactive exploration of networks is currently challenging because: (1) it is difficult to find patterns and comprehend the structure of networks with many nodes and links, and (2) current systems are often a medley of statistical methods and overwhelming visual output which leaves many analysts uncertain about how to explore in an orderly manner. This results in exploration that is largely opportunistic. Our contributions are techniques to help structural analysts understand social networks more effectively. We present SocialAction, a system that uses attribute ranking and coordinated views to help users systematically examine numerous SNA measures. Users can (1) flexibly iterate through visualizations of measures to gain an overview, filter nodes, and find outliers, (2) aggregate networks using link structure, find cohesive subgroups, and focus on communities of interest, and (3) untangle networks by viewing different link types separately, or find patterns across different link types using a matrix overview. For each operation, a stable node layout is maintained in the network visualization so users can make comparisons. SocialAction offers analysts a strategy beyond opportunism, as it provides systematic, yet flexible, techniques for exploring social networks.},

Some of the tools support a wide range of visualization options, including interactive views. Others have better support for calculating structural graph properties such as the density of the graph or deploying traditional statistical social network analysis. We present Invenio, a new tool for visual mining of socials. Invenio integrates a wide range of interactive visualization options from Prefuse, with graph mining algorithm support from JUNG. While the integration expands the breadth of functionality within the core engine of the tool, our goal is to interactively explore multi-modal, multi-relational social networks. Invenio also supports construction of views using both database operations and basic graph mining operations.},

First, a technological viewpoint is adopted, where the value of visualization is measured based on effectiveness and efficiency. An economic model of visualization is presented and benefits and costs are established. Next, consequences and limitations of visualization are discussed (including the use of alternative methods, high initial costs, subjectiveness, and the role of interaction). Example uses of the model for the judgment of existing classes of methods are given to understand why they are or are not used in practice. However, such an economic view is too restrictive.

Data mining techniques provide many metrics and statistics useful to understand the structure of a website, and the use its users make of it, but they are still not easy to interpret and to understand. Most of these metrics can also be combined, in order to discover new trends and patterns. We present a preliminary prototype of an exploratory search system for web mining which main goal is to provide a set of tools and visual representations that allow the user to explore and to decide how to represent the available data. This approach defines a system that will help us to evaluate the usability of the implemented interactions and visual metaphors.},

In organiza- tions, some people assist others in locating expertise by making referrals. People who make referrals fill key organ- izational roles that have been identified by CSCW and af- filiated research.

abstract = {Sensors can capture very sensitive and valuable information without human intervention and send it to remote location. However, capturing sensory data from a body sensor network (BSN) and sending it to social networks is a challenging task. This is because it requires a number of distributed networks to work together seamlessly. The task becomes more challenging when both the BSN and the social networks are mobile. It requires a framework which can handle the mobility of both the BSN and members of social networks and can send the sensory data to the social networks for real-time visualization. In this paper, we propose an open source framework, named SenseFace, which seamlessly incorporates a four-tier network including a BSN, cellular network, Internet and an overlay network consisting of social networks, to pass sensory data from a mobile BSN to the overlay network. The overlay network can intelligently manage one's social network and produce different data visualization formats suitable for email, fax, voicemail, SMS, MMS, APRS network, IM networks such as hotmail, gmail, yahoo, and existing social networks such as Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, delicious, Wordpress etc. Finally, we present the framework design and the hardware and software that have been used for the implementation of the framework.},

We suggest that such visualizations can be of interest not only to analysts and researchers but also to the people whose data is being analyzed. In this paper we briefly talk about two visualizations of email that we developed to give people a better sense of their email archives and social networks. One visualization shows a traditional network graph with email contacts as nodes. The second visualization depicts the temporal rhythms of interactions in dyadic relationships between ego and individual contacts. While observing and interviewing users of these systems, it became clear that, when used in tandem, these visualizations complemented and clarified each others depiction of a persons social network. Based on our experience with these two systems, we propose that visualizations of social networks that are aimed at end users ought to go beyond the graph paradigm. We posit that basic cartographic principles such as adaptive zooming and multiple viewing modes provide system designers with useful visual solutions to the depiction of social networks.},

DSMs are used throughout the engineering community for various applications, such as process modelling or change prediction. However, outside this community, DSMs (and other matrix-based representations of graphs) are rarely applied and node-link diagrams are very popular. This paper will examine, which representation is more suitable for visualising graphs. For this purpose, several user experiments were conducted that aimed to answer this research question in the context of product models used, for example in engineering, but the results can be generalised to other applications. These experiments identify key factors on the readability of graph visualisations and confirm work on comparisons of different representations. This study widens the scope of readability comparisons between node-link and matrix-based representations by introducing new user tasks and replacing simulated, undirected graphs with directed ones employing real-world semantics.},

Here, research on social cohesion and social embeddedness is linked by developing a concept of structural cohesion based on network node connectivity. Structural cohesion is defined as the minimum number of actors who, if removed from a group, would disconnect the group. A structural dimension of embeddedness can then be defined through the hierarchical nesting of these cohesive structures. The empirical applicability of nestedness is demonstrated in two dramatically different substantive settings, and additional theo- retical implications with reference to a wide array of substantive fields are dis- cussed.},

abstract = {Although visualizations are components of many information interfaces, testing of these visual elements is rarely undertaken except as a part of overall usability testing. For this reason, it is unclear what role, if any, visualizations actually perform. Our method involves the creation of simple visual prototypes and task sets based on a visual taxonomy which allows testing of the visualization in isolation from the rest of the system. By de"ning tests using a visual taxonomy rather than customary tasks from the application domain, our method circumvents the problems of restricting evaluation of newer more capable systems to only those tasks which might be accomplished with older, less capable ones. This paper will discuss methods for exhaustively testing the capabilities of a visualization by mapping from a domain-independent taxonomy of visual tasks to a speci"c domain, i.e. information retrieval. Experimental results are presented illustrating this approach to determining the role visualizations may play in supporting users in information-seeking environments. Our methods could easily be extended to other domains including data visualization.},

abstract = {Due to the advancement of Web 2.0 technologies, a large volume of Web opinions is available on social media sites such as Web forums and Weblogs. These technologies provide a platform for Internet users around the world to communicate with each other and express their opinions. Analysis of developing Web opinions is potentially valuable for discovering ongoing topics of interests of the public like terrorist and crime detection, understanding how topics evolve together with the underlying social interaction between participants, and identifying important participants who have great influence in various topics of discussions. Nonetheless, the work of analyzing and clustering Web opinions is extremely challenging. Unlike regular documents, Web opinions are short and sparse text messages with noisy content. Typical document clustering techniques with the goal of clustering all documents applied to Web opinions produce unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we investigated the density-based clustering algorithm and proposed the scalable distance-based clustering technique for Web opinion clustering. We conducted experiments and benchmarked with the density-based algorithm to show that the new algorithm obtains higher microaccuracy and macroaccuracy. This Web opinion clustering technique enables the identification of themes within discussions in Web social networks and their development, as well as the interactions of active participants. We also developed interactive visualization tools, which make use of the identified topic clusters to display social network development, the network topology similarity between topics, and the similarity values between participants.},

abstract = {Social network analysis (SNA) has emerged as a powerful method for understanding the importance of relationships in networks. However, interactive exploration of networks is currently challenging because: (1) it is difficult to find patterns and comprehend the structure of networks with many nodes and links, and (2) current systems are often a medley of statistical methods and overwhelming visual output which leaves many analysts uncertain about how to explore in an orderly manner. This results in exploration that is largely opportunistic. Our contributions are techniques to help structural analysts understand social networks more effectively. We present SocialAction, a system that uses attribute ranking and coordinated views to help users systematically examine numerous SNA measures. Users can (1) flexibly iterate through visualizations of measures to gain an overview, filter nodes, and find outliers, (2) aggregate networks using link structure, find cohesive subgroups, and focus on communities of interest, and (3) untangle networks by viewing different link types separately, or find patterns across different link types using a matrix overview. For each operation, a stable node layout is maintained in the network visualization so users can make comparisons. SocialAction offers analysts a strategy beyond opportunism, as it provides systematic, yet flexible, techniques for exploring social networks.},

abstract = {Social network concepts are invaluable for understanding the social network phenomena, but they are difficult to comprehend without computerized visualization. However, most existing network visualization techniques provide limited support for the comprehension of network concepts. This research proposes an approach called concept visualization to facilitate the understanding of social network concepts. The paper describes an implementation of the approach. Results from a controlled laboratory experiment indicate that, compared with the benchmark system, the NetVizer system facilitated better understanding of the concepts of betweenness centrality, gatekeepers of subgroups, and structural similarity. It also supported a faster comprehension of subgroup identification.},

@article{Newman2004,
abstract = {The connections in many networks are not merely binary entities, either present or not, but have associated weights that record their strengths relative to one another. Recent studies of networks have, by and large, steered clear of such weighted networks, which are often perceived as being harder to analyze than their unweighted counterparts. Here we point out that weighted networks can in many cases be analyzed using a simple mapping from a weighted network to an unweighted multigraph, allowing us to apply standard techniques for unweighted graphs to weighted ones as well. We give a number of examples of the method, including an algorithm for detecting community structure in weighted networks and a new and simple proof of the max-flow/min-cut theorem.},

@article{Harrer2009,
abstract = {In this paper we will demonstrate the potential of processing and visualising the dynamics of computer-mediated communities by means of Social Network Analysis. According to the fact that computer-mediated community systems are manifested also as structured data, we use data structures like e-mail, discussion boards, and bibliography sources for an automatic transformation into social network data formats. Currently our developed converter DMD (Data Multiplexer Demultiplexer) supports GraphML, UCINET, and Pajek formats besides our own data formats which are used for real-time analysis of CSCL (Computer Supported Collaborative Learning) activities. In the case of communication data our converters utilize conversation graphs reflecting aspects of speech act and conversational theory to produce directed graphs in the cases where one-mode person networks are desired. The paper will demonstrate a 3-dimensional visualisation of an author community based on Bibtex bibliography data converted into GraphML. Based on this dataset we visualise publications network with a tool called Weaver, which is developed in our research group. According to Lothar Krempelpsilas algorithm, Weaver uses the first two dimensions to embed the network structure within a common solution space. The third dimension is used for representing the time axis and thus the dynamics of co-authorship relations.Concluding we aim to discuss potential issues and problems of our approach and the possibilities especially concerning the appropriate visualisation and segmentation of long term communications, such as mailing lists.},

Examples are social networks, software structures, bibliographic references and biological neural nets. Their high connectivity makes both finding a pleasing layout and a suitable clustering hard. In this paper we present a method to create scalable, interactive visualizations of small world graphs, allowing the user to inspect local clusters while maintaining a global overview of the entire structure. The visualization method uses a combination of both semantical and geometrical distortions, while the layout is generated by a spring embedder algorithm using recently developed force model. We use a cross referenced database of 500 artists as a running example},

To adequately understand this social cyberspace, we must be able to search and explore the patterns and processes of group interaction. A novel software-based approach addresses this objective. The method is built on the concepts of social translucency and social network analysis, extending the latter by including keyword analysis, dynamic network visualization, and additional modeling properties. On the basis of these models, the authors suggest a visualization-based procedure for searching and exploring social corpora using combinable filtering algorithms. They offer two examples-an electronic discussion and a corporate email network-to demonstrate search and retrieval in networks. Their examples further yield novel insights into the actual dynamics of content dissemination and network evolvement among virtual network members.},

How many co-authors are typical for a research paper today and 20 years ago? Who are the most prolific writers? In this paper, we attempt to address these questions as well as study collaboration patterns, research communities, interactions between related research specialties, and the evolution of these characteristics through time. For our analysis we use data from the Association of Computing Machinery's Digital Library of Scientific Literature (ACM Portal) which contains over a hundred thousand research papers and authors. We use a novel technique for visualization of large graphs that evolve through time. Given a dynamic graph, the layout algorithm produces two-dimensional representations of each time-slice, while preserving the mental map of the graph from one slice to the next. A combined view, with all the time-slices can also be viewed and explored. Graphs with tens of thousands of vertices and edges, resulting from specific queries to our local copy of the ACM database, are generated and displayed in seconds. The images in this paper are produced by a graph layout tool which uses the dynamic graph layout algorithm.},

With the Rapid Expansion of social network, it is necessary to provide a holistic view to the users and researchers to understand the effect of information communicated in the network. The social network users will be visualized in 3-dimension space, with 2-dimension graph layouts delivering various characteristic of the network. The layout is mainly based on user’s role in the network, but not the relationship of users in the traditional way. By visualizing the disseminating and stop of information flow among users, we can distinguish users by their effect and contribution in communication among the network. The visualization combines technology, content and expression. We can then study the social network by the performance of the network structure situation and information flow.},

Through social networks analysis we intend to detect sub-networks within the Nordic network, the position and role of the different university web domains and to understand the structural topology of this web space. Co-link analysis, with asymmetrical matrices and cosine measure, is used to identify thematic clusters. Results show that the Nordic network is a cohesive network, set up by three well-defined sub-networks and it rests on the Finnish and Swedish sub-networks. We conclude that the Danish network has less visibility than other Nordic countries. The Swedish one is the principal Nordic sub-network and the Finland network is a slightly isolated from Europe, with the exception of the University of Helsinki.},

This article confronts theoretical questions surrounding the temporal representations of social networks and technical questions about how best to link network change to changes in the graphical representation. The authors divide network movies into (1) static flip books, where node position remains constant but edges cumulate over time, and (2) dynamic movies, where nodes move as a function of changes in relations. Flip books are particularly useful in contexts where relations are sparse. For more connected networks, movies are often more appropriate. Three empirical examples demonstrate the advantages of different movie styles. A new software program for creating network movies is discussed in the appendix.},
